Hi, I'm Six (that's my nickname).

I'm a software developer in the SF Bay Area. I'm crazy about working with open source operating systems like Linux and Android. I especially enjoy coding in Python and hacking away in Bash.

Most of my development work has been for personal use, but I'm increasingly interested in professional opportunities. Feel free to let me know if you encounter any issues or have other feedback regarding any of the software I publish.
