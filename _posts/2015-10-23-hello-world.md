I'll be using this blog as a sounding board to record some of my thoughts on development, particularly as they pertain to Linux and open source. This will serve as a repository for solutions to technical problems, reviews of useful tools, and discussion of some of the projects I work on.

Hopefully I can help make a small contribution to the technical collective consciousness from which I've so greatly benefited.
